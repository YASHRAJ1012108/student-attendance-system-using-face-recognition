# student-attendance-system-using-face-recognition
INTRODUCTION :
The Advanced Attendance System is designed to simplify the process of taking attendance for teachers. By implementing face recognition technology, the system eliminates the need for manual attendance, saving time and reducing human efforts. Unlike traditional methods where students can provide proxy attendance, the face recognition feature ensures accuracy and prevents any form of attendance fraud. This project revolutionizes the attendance tracking process, enhancing efficiency and ensuring reliable attendance records.

THE PROBLEM :
The attendance problem has become increasingly challenging in modern times. Manual attendance-taking consumes a significant amount of time, often leading to reduced instructional hours. Inaccurate or missed attendance records can result in attendance shortages for students. The traditional roll call method is impractical, especially in classrooms with high student ratios where proxy attendance is common. However, this project offers a solution to address these issues effectively.
